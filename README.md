# Pill Survivor Sample Project
Pill Survivors is a prototype for a "Vampire Survivors" style roguelite game. The unity project serves as a base for a more complex project, but has all the components that make up the gameplay loop of a vampire survivors like game: slaying enemies, leveling up, repeat. This project implements game design patterns such as object pooling, singletons, and state behaviour. The developed product in this stage is open source and free to use within the realm the CC-BY-SA license permits.

# ...Vincent: Soul Survivor
The code used for this sample project was the foundation for a new project I plan to release in October 2024 called "...Vincent: Soul Survival".
